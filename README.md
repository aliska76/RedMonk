# RedMonk
Red Monk is a general Android assistant application for diabetics. :rose:

The application allows to store and periodically change user physical stats, keep track of their medication schedule, calorie consumption, maintain a list of medical contacts and setup emergency buttons (as widgets) to quicky contact them.

Project Status: <b>PRE ALPHA</b> :wrench:

This project is still in it's infency and is under heavy development. basically it's unusable right now, so forking this repo at this stage is pointless.
